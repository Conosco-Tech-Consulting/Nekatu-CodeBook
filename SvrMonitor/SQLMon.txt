=========
But that query looks wrong in several respects. Unless I'm wrong you cannot
have two tables in the FROM clause. More likely you want to use a JOIN.
Also, Computer.Properties is probably ComputerProperties. Also, if you are
retrieving values from more than one table (with a JOIN) you may need to
identify the table the fields apply to (Perhaps
ComputerProperties.ComputerName for example). The query might be similar to:
=============
strQuery = "SELECT ComputerName, DatVer, UserName " _
    & "FROM ComputerProperties " _
    & "INNER JOIN  ProductProperties " _
        & "ON WHERE ComputerProperties.ParentID = ProductProperties.ParentID
" _
    & "WHERE ProductProperties.ProductCode = 'Viruscan8600' " _
        & "AND DatVer < '5315' " _
    & "ORDER BY ComputerName"

Wscript.Echo strQuery
